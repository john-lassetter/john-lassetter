### About Me

Professionally, I am a scientist at heart. I studied physics in college, because I have always been drawn to ask why things work. During the later half of my Bachelor's degree
and especially during my Master's degree, I realized that one of the parts of being a physicist I loved most was analyzing and modeling the data, and writing and learning to code 
in general. This realization, along with a sudden obsession with the theory and practicality of Machine Learning, drove me to stray from my original plan and pursue a career in 
data science. So far, this repo is populated mostly with the code I have written on my journey to build the skills to enter this career.

<!-- In addition to my professional journey and pursuits, I am a music lover, dog lover, and video game hobbyist. I play a few instruments and love to discover new music, no matter 
the genre. -->
